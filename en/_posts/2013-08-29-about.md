###About This Blog
I just purchased this domain (hary.my.id, ed) today, 29 Aug 2013.
More story about this domain can be found [here]({% post_url 2013-08-30-new-domain %}).

I am going to use this as my technical blog, and my old primary blog will be used for learning language (hopefully).

For some of you who wants to know technical, this blog is hosted at github [pages](http://pages.github.com), powered by [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), using [slate](https://github.com/jsncostello/slate) template, and edited with `vi` on my laptop, yup I manually create and edit every page on this blog.


###About Me
My name is [hary](http://hary.web.id/en), proud user of `.id`. I live and work in Jakarta. I am single, but I wish to get married very soon. :D

PS: There's nothing here though. Anyway, thank you for visiting. 

If you want to contact me, you can sent email to `anything at hary.web.id`.
