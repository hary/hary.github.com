###About This Blog
I just purchased this domain today, 29 Aug 2013.
More story about this domain can be found [here]({% post_url 2013-08-30-new-domain %}).

I am going to use this as my technical blog, and my old primary blog will be used for learning language (hopefully).

This blog is hosted at github [pages](http://pages.github.com), powered by [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), using [slate](https://github.com/jsncostello/slate) template, and edited with `vi`.

###About Me
My name is [hary](http://hary.my.id/en), proud user of `.id`. I live and work in Jakarta. I am single, but I wish to get married very soon. :D

PS: There's nothing here though. Anyway, thank you for visiting. 

If you want to contact me, you can sent email to `me at hary.web.id`.
